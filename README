<Describe your project's features here>
we decided to add sound effects to our project using the pygame module.
this adds greater responsiveness to the game by giving feedback,
and allows the user to have a better sense of control and alerts them
when time is running out. 
we created a sound for a click, for finding a correct word or if an incorrect word was submitted
as well as for the end of the game.
