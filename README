We decided to add sound effects to our project using the pygame module.
this adds greater responsiveness to the game by giving feedback,
and allows the user to have a better sense of control and alerts them
when time is running out. 
We created a sound for a click, for finding a correct word or if an incorrect word was submitted
as well as for the end of the game.
We also added a correspondive color which each pressed button flash depending on the result - Green for success, Red for failure.
Buttons become blue when pressed, and revert back to their original color when pressed again.
